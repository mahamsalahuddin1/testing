        "visa": {
	"answer": "Managing visa formalities is an essential part of studying at Emirates Aviation University, and we’re here to support you every step of the way. For full-time students, a valid UAE residence visa is mandatory throughout your study period. EAU offers assistance with obtaining a student visa under university sponsorship, provided all registration requirements are fulfilled and tuition fees are paid. This visa, typically valid for one year, can be renewed for returning students, with processing fees borne by the applicant. If circumstances change—such as withdrawal from the program—the visa must be canceled immediately, with students required to leave the UAE or secure alternative sponsorship. For overseas students attending entrance tests, arranging a visit visa remains their responsibility. EAU ensures a fair process by refunding tuition fees (excluding registration and incurred processing fees) in cases of visa rejection. For any queries, our dedicated visa team is available at eau.visa@emirates.com to provide detailed guidance."
